# Sample PDF Testing

Since I cannot create actual PDF files directly, here's the content you can use to create a test PDF:

## Sample PDF Content:

**Title: TextForge AI - PDF Processing Test Document**

This is a sample PDF document to test the PDF upload functionality in TextForge AI application.

**Key Features:**
- PDF text extraction using PyPDF2
- Support for multi-page documents
- Automatic text processing with AI models
- File size validation (up to 50KB for PDFs)

**Sample Text for Testing:**

"Artificial Intelligence has revolutionized the way we process and understand text. Natural Language Processing enables machines to comprehend human language, making it possible to perform tasks like paraphrasing, grammar correction, and content summarization automatically.

The integration of AI models like T5 and BART has made these capabilities more accessible to developers and end-users alike. With proper implementation, these tools can significantly enhance productivity and communication effectiveness."

**How to Create a Test PDF:**
1. Copy the content above
2. Paste it into any word processor (Word, Google Docs, etc.)
3. Save/Export as PDF
4. Use this PDF to test the upload functionality

The system will extract text from your PDF and process it with the selected AI feature.
